Git is a holy grail of computer scientists. 

If you are into coding you will eventually have to learn how to use it. It's a version control system.

What's that? You might ask.


Imagine a project like a tree, in a project there are generally a lot of different programmers working at the same time. 

This type of thing makes it possible for software engeneers work on the same project without interfering eachother's work. It allows users to create branches, which are independent lines of development. These branches can be merged back into the main codebase when the changes are ready.
